* matplotlib ‚â• 3.7

Install all dependencies via:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## **loss.py**

Implements two NCE variants:

* `nce_loss`: log-sum-exp based formulation
* `nce_loss2`: logistic version using `logsigmoid`

The model discriminates between **real data** and **noise samples**:
$$
x \sim p_{\text{data}}, \quad \tilde{x} \sim p_n
$$

---

## **sampling.py**

Performs **Langevin Dynamics** in latent space to sample from the learned energy distribution:
$$
x_{t+1} = x_t + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \nabla_x f_\theta(x_t) + \sqrt{\epsilon},\eta_t, \quad
\eta_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

The **choice of the noise distribution** ( p_n(x) ) has a **strong impact on model performance**.
A well-chosen noise helps the model correctly estimate the energy boundaries between real and synthetic samples.
Conversely, a noise distribution that is too simple or too distant from the data distribution can lead to unstable training and poor generalization.
